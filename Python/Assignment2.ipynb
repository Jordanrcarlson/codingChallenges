These percentage grades are converted to *letter grades* and *grade point values* using a __[table](https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2018-09/undergrad/info/regulations/grading.html)__ in the academic calendar.  \n",

For each course, the input will include both the number of units and student's percentage grade.  After inputting one course, the program will prompt to determine if there is another.  Although the university defines a number of different failing grades, for the purposes of this program, you can assume all percentage grades less than 50 will be awarded the letter grade F. \n",
